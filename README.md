<h2>ABOUT THE MAGENTO 2 RECENTLY VIEWED PRODUCTS BAR EXTENSION.</h2>
                        <ul>
                        <p>
                        Reasons may vary, but oftentimes your customers need to return to a previously visited item. Maybe they are checking compatibility between a number of products or comparing several similar items before a purchase. Perhaps they want to return to a certain product scope by using the breadcrumbs to travel back up the category hierarchy.

Bottom line: a strong Magento recently viewed products block is important. Without this the customers have less control of the browsing experience, and they are left with only a few options. Going back to the search bar, plowing through long categories, or an extensive use of their browser’s “back” button. These friction points could be deal breakers.

Make it simple for your customers by having a Recently Viewed Items list readily available through the entire site. They will be reassured that finding products again will be hassle-free, so they won’t mind exploring for more items. These extra items are more sales waiting to happen!

Because the list is automatically generated for any user, it is worth considering a couple of privacy features. While many customers will find the Recently Viewed Items list helpful, some may wish to keep their history private. If a customer doesn’t want others to see the products they’ve browsed they have the option to Clear All. As the name suggests, this allows them to instantly clear all products in their current list.

Our Magento Recently Viewed Products Extension includes the option to add a custom static block right next to your list. This feature is for customers that are signed in. On this static block you can easily add promotions, or featured sales and categories. This will improve visibility to those sections of your website for returning customers.

This extension integrates seamlessly with the Magento 2 Social Login module. Doing this will display a login section instead of the block, if the user is not logged in. After the sign in process is completed, the sample block is shown as normal.
<h2>SOCIAL LOGIN INTEGRATION</h2>
Customers visit your website from multiple devices and browsers. A shopping journey can be complex! It’s not uncommon to begin on a work desktop and then continue onto a mobile phone during the train ride. And then finally, when they do convert, it’s at home on a tablet or personal computer! It’s likely that they may have viewed several other products that caught their attention. If these items weren’t bookmarked or added to a wishlist they will have to be relocated from scratch. This is a high effort situation that often leads to major frustration and decreased conversion.

Having your customers create an account and remain logged in is a key priority in delivering the best possible shopping experience. This allows you to retain browsing history, assure easy access to personalized offers, and to collect the necessary data for optimization.

Integrating the Recently Viewed Magento 2 Extension with the Social Login Extension makes this easy to achieve. Social Media integration gives your customers easy access to logging in and having their shopping history saved. Increased logins help to grow your customer base and newsletter subscribers, as well as offering a effortless, consistent shopping experience.

<strong>1.</strong> Head into Admin -> Content -> Blocks.

<strong>2.</strong> Find the Recently Viewed Sample Block.
<p>
<strong>3.</strong> Replace the content with the following:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
